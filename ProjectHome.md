Nowadays, client-side Web technologies deliver rich interactive interfaces to the users, such as Facebook and YouTube.
However, the client-side image editing technologies have not become successful yet. The main reason for this was the lack
of technology and slow speed of JavaScript. But none of these obstacles are valid anymore:
•On the technology side, HTML Canvas enables developers to render fast 2D graphics inside the Web browser
without any plugin.
•On the JavaScript side, the new JavaScript engines are becoming super fast so that in some cases they even
outperform Java-based equivalent applications.

The goal of this project is to develop a JavaScript-based image editor with medium-to-high ceiling and low learning
threshold. Users should be able to draw their images of interest easily using the image editor.
